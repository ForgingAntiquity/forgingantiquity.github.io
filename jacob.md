Jacob Gwiazdzinski is a Masters of Research student at Macquarie University with a Bachelor in Archaeology from Flinders University where he developed particular expertise in applying technical methods to answering spatial questions of archaeological sites. He is working as a PACE intern on the ARC Discovery Project, Forging Antiquity: Authenticity, forgery and fake papyri. As objects are fundamental to the way we articulate our relationship to other people and the world we inhabit, Jacobâ€™s principle research interests concern understanding the ways that societies dynamically interact with objects. To identify the traces of this subtle dynamic his research uses archaeometric and technological methods to determining micro-scale patterns of human behaviour as a way of informing how societies operate and evolve.

Our reliance on objects for making social contracts tangible and affirming our presence seems at odds with our mass-produced disposable culture. In this context, the participation of objects in the construction, perpetuation and destruction of cultures illustrates their significance. The multiple lives of ancient objects, from the context of their creation to their reception in the museum and market, speak to the ways in which natural and constructed objects are used to express intangible or implicit sociocultural ideas.
