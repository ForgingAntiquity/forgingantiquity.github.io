# About us

This project grew from three sources: sections of the graduate course on historiography Yuen-Collingridge taught
at Macquarie University provided the framework for an investigaiton of authenticity and forgery in relation to the 
ancient world; Choat's involvement in the 'Gospel of Jesus' Wife' affair and his participation in a Society of Biblical 
Literature taskfoce on Unprovenanced antiquties led to his interest in forgeries and issues of culutral heritage; and 
collaboration between Astm Choat, and Yuen-Collingridge in earlier projects focussing on scribal practice in the papyri
led to further questions about scribal practice which are inter alia addressed in this project. Dundler's Masters of 
Research thesis project on the internet trade in papyri was inspired by Yuen-Collingridge's historiography course and 
developed in discussion with Choat and Yuen-Collingridge to dovetail with the forgery project.

While the primary focus of the project is forged papyri in Greek, Coptic, or simulated script from (or allegedly from)
Egypt, it is framed within a broader investigation of authenticity, expertise, and cultural heritage. The significance 
of the past is nowhere more evident than when its authenticity is called into question. How do we recognise the ‘authentic
past’, and on what basis do we decide what aspects of it are allowed to participate in our present? Is assessing the past, 
how do we detect and guard against forgery, and what does the forging of artefacts, and the manner in which we detect them,
tell us about the importance of the past to the present?

Forgeries can undermine or support dominant institutions and practices, and unsettle the public’s confidence both in the past
itself, and in the disciplinary expertise of those who comment on it. The unmasking of forgeries can erode the popular perception
of a single ‘authentic past’ which enables many popular traditions. In the internet age, when access to information and participation
in debate has become much wider and more immediate, the public reception of the methods, results, and personalities of academic
scholarship has become particularly prominent, especially in the case of accusations of forgery. In the process, new questions have
arisen about how we trust the past as presented to us by both professional and amateur commentators, and what constitutes the authority
to participate in debates about the past.

We aim to combine technical and historiographic analysis, situating close examination of forged papyri within socio-historical 
perspectives on the work of forgers, and the role their productions play in academic and public discussions of the past. 
By studying the production of forged manuscripts alongside evolving strategies for their detection, we hope to provide insights 
into the development of authentication strategies, and the means by which forgeries are produced and detected. Via examination 
of the way debates over forged antiquities engage with other contemporary issues and positioning the development of academic 
professionalism in relation to evolving public views of the past, we hope to illuminate alignments and disjunctions between 
academic and popular views on the value of the past, and on who has the authority to determine authenticity.

## Aims

The project aims to produce a full typology of forged papyri of all types, from the early modern period to the 
present day, by a close exmaination of fake papyri of every type. Alongside this, we investigate how papyrus 
forgers work, both in terms of the methods they use, and the assumptions about the past which they exploit when
producing fakes. In doing do, we will locate and contextualise debates over forged papyri within contemporary
discussions, in particular debates over the ethics and practice of the antiquities trade and the related problem 
of the illegal trafficking of artefacts; and public perceptions of the relative value of scientific and
humanities expertise in the detection of forged artefacts.

* Journal articles and book chapters relating to the theme. Those in progress so far include:
  * a treatment by Yuen-Collingridge of 16th century forger Pierre Hamon;
  * an article by Choat on the development of authenticating techniques by Jean Mabillon;
  * a chapter by Choat on Forged papyri in a Handbook on Art Crime edited by Saskia Maria Hufnagel & Duncan Chappell (Palgrave Macmillan).

* A volume, co-edited by the project team along with collaborators, on forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt, with editions and commentary.

* A monograph, co-authored by Choat and Yuen-Collingridge, on the mid-nineteenth century master forger and self-taught manuscript expert Constantine Simonides. 
This will focus primarily on the collection of forged papyri in the World Museum at Liverpool and on Simonides' time in 
England in 1859--1863, telling the story of someone forging Greek history, and selling it (literally and metaphorically)
to the English.

* An online database of forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt.

* A study by Dundler of the Internet trade in papyrus.
