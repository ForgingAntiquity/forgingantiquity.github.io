## 20–22 September 2018, 
### Macquarie University, Sydney

The conference "Manuscripts from the Margins" gathers together a group of the world's leading experts in fake texts from throughout history to examine the forging of manuscripts (defined widely to include all surfaces on which writing is found) of all sorts. The conference has two parts. A two-day workshop on the 20th–21st September, "How to Edit a Forgery", and a day of public lectures on synthetic themes, "Faking it". Information on both may be found below.

The **keynote speaker** will be Professor Christopher Rollston, Associate Professor of Northwest Semitic languages and literatures, Department of Classical and Near Eastern languages and Civilizations, George Washington University, Washington D.C.

Funding for this conference has been provided by the Ian Potter Foundation, the Australian Research Council, the MQ Ancient Culutres Research Centre,the Sir Asher Joel Foundation, and the Society for the Study of Early Christianity.

### Manuscripts from the Margins: How to Edit a Forgery
#### Macquarie University, 20–21 September 2018.

This two-day workshop will address issues invovled working with, editing, and publishing forgeries (certain or alleged) through the presentation of a diverse range of textual forgeries purporting to be from antiquity through to the early modern period.

The how and why of editing forged texts is a largely unarticulated domain. Whilst forgeries are ubiquitous in collections everywhere, they remain understudied and unappreciated. Efforts have concentrated on the identification of telltale signs of duplicity, rather than on the mechanics used to feign authenticity. As the intention of forgers differs from that of pre-modern scribes, the publication of textual remains cannot proceed as usual. Lacunae may be intentional and text fragmentary from its inception.

Palaeographical description and the registering of other metatextual features are further complicated by the aspirations and failures of forgers. What sorts of comparisons are possible or even responsible? How much of the traditional repertoire of conventional signs and symbols should we read into ambiguous marks? Do we engage with the artefact as executed or imagined? Is it ethical to publish editions which make transparent forgers’ techniques? Does scholarly engagement with forgeries merely warn future fakers of things they should avoid?

These questions illustrate some of the potential problems which attend the publication of forgeries. These issues will form the basis of discussion through the following presentations.

### Faking it:Manuscripts from the Margins
#### Australian Hearing Hub, Level 1 Lecture Theatre, Macquarie University, 22 September 2018.

When it comes to the past, wherever truth matters, fakes abound. The creation, distortion, manipulation, or reconstitution of information shapes our experience of the world at every level. The growing sophistication of technology seems to have amplified rather than solved the problem. Telling ‘real’ from ‘fake’, ‘true’ from ‘false’, ‘original’ from ‘copy’ is not simply a dilemma of modern information technology, but a crisis of history, which haunts every vehicle we use to exemplify and affirm ‘facts’ about the world. This public event brings together twelve international and local experts to present diverse perspectives on forgery, including discussions of fake texts on stone, papyrus, parchment, and paper, the effect of fakes on antiquities markets and scholarship, and the relationship between fake, copy, and replica in the digital age. From the Book of the Dead to the Dead Sea Scrolls, via inscriptions, papyri, charters, letters, and other texts from the ancient to early modern world, this event will examine the importance of forgeries for the way we assess and communicate history, and how they effect our view of both the past and the present.
