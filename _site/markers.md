network which draws on research expertise from across the Faculty of Arts to host
conversations about the markers of authenticity in human experience of the contemporary
and past worlds from a range of perspectives. ‘Markers of Authenticity’ hosts a seminar
series convened by Malcolm Choat, Rachel Yuen-Collingridge, and Lauren Dundler, and a
