## Forgeries known to the project

We provide here a list of those fake papyri and related manuscripts which have come to the notice of the project so far. We provide it here as a preliminary resource for those who are interested, in advance of a fully searchable database which is currently being constructed. The table below pull data directly from the Google Sheet in which informaiton on fakes is currently stored. While sorting and filtering are not possible within this frame, material can be searched for by using CNTRL+F /CMD+F functions. A full bibliography of works cited may be found below the table.

The "Typology" column contains the classification of the forgeries into the categories established within the project. While most of the categories are self-explanatory, a page currently under construction will provide a full description of this typology.
