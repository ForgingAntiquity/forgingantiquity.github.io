# Markers of Authenticity 

'Forging Antiquity' is part of the 'Markers of Authenticity' research cluster 
within the Faculty of Arts at Macquarie University, a cross-disciplinary research
network which draws on research expertise from across the Faculty of Arts and beyond 
to host conversations about the markers of authenticity in human experience of the 
contemporary and past worlds from a range of perspectives. 
How do we distinguish the real from the fake? How can we trust what we perceive? How 
stable is our hold on the truth? This cross-disciplinary research network seeks to 
understand why authenticity matters so much and to look at the ways in which it has been
used to construct our relationship with the past, with ourselves and one another, with
objects, animals, and the environment. The research program takes on issues as diverse 
as authorial and creative practice; memory and cognition; cultural heritage; looting and
the antiquities trade; forgery; the relationship between the academy and the public; the
expert and the amateur; technique and motivation; performance and experience; natural and
artificial environments; virtual worlds and the augmentation of the body and our senses. 

'Markers of Authenticity' hosts a seminar series convened by Malcolm Choat, Rachel 
Yuen-Collingridge, and Lauren Dundler, and a blog at [markersofauthenticity.com](https://markersofauthenticity.com).
