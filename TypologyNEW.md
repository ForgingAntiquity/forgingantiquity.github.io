# Typology of Forged Manuscripts

The typology of forged manuscripts adopted by the project separates forgeries along four axes: according to their support, content, material, and script. In the database these are listed with a forward slashes (/) between them. Subcategories are listed with brackets, etc Reuse (secondary use), copy (exact) etc. 

| **Support**  | Ancient        | Composite                                                                         | Modern              |      |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------|
| **Use**      | First use      | Reuse <br> - Palimpsest <br> - Secondary use <br> - Supplementary use <br> - Reconstituted |                     |      |
| **Script**   | Simulated      | Adapted                                                                           | Aspirational        | Authentic  |
| **Content**  | Nonsense       | Composition <br> - Augmentation <br> - Patchwork <br> - Inspired                   | Copy <br> - Exact <br> - Adaptation |      |

# Support

## _Ancient_
The support is an authentically ancient piece of papyrus/parchment/ostracon.

## _Composite_
Pieces of papyrus/parchment/linen or other material support from separate original manuscripts, attached together to form a single sheet, thus creating a new artefact.

## _Modern_
A material support constructed in the modern period is used for a forgery.

# Use

## _First Use_
The papyrus/ostracon is used for the first time to create a forgery.

## _Reuse_
- **Palimpsest:** Existing text is erased and a new one written over it.
- **Secondary Use:** The reuse of the back of an existing ancient text.
- **Supplementary Use:** Modern additions are made to traces of a pre-existing ancient text.
- **Reconstituted Use:** The arrangement of fragments of ancient text without modern additions to constitute a new textual artefact.

# Script

## _Simulated Alphabet_
Fabricated alphabetic forms: the majority of forms are not identifiable, even if some resemble real forms.

## _Adapted Alphabet_
Letters from an identifiable alphabet(s) mixed with invented forms.

## _Aspirational_
Script is a real alphabet that aspires to reproduce a genuine consistent script.

## _Authentic_
The papyrus contains genuine ancient script.

# Content

## _Nonsense_
The text makes no sense either because there was no attempt to create or copy coherent text, or the fragments of authentic text which were recombined to make the forgery do not together construct coherent text.

## _Composition_
A text substantially composed, either physically or textually, by the forger. This category can be subdivided as follows:
- **Augmented text:** A new text is added to authentic text already present on the support.
- **Patchwork text:** Selections from either one or multiple texts have been combined and reproduced as a single, new text, with or without additional composition by the forger.
- **Inspired text:** The text is inspired by ancient traditions, whether by genre or by mention of a lost work or author, but a specific model was not used.

## _Copy_
A copy or version of an already known text, being either:
- **Exact text:** The forgery reproduces the exact text of an existing model, though it may have an independent or modified format or accidental variations from the model.
- **Adaptation text:** A text which has been copied in part or substantially from an existing model, but in which variations from or minor additions to the existing text have been deliberately introduced.
