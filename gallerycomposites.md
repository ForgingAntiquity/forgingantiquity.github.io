### Types of papyrus forgery: Composites

One of the most common types of fake are composites made by 
sticking together a number of fragments from genuine papyri. 
Sometimes the pieces come from the one original papyrus, but
often they are easily recognisable because clearly separate 
papyri have been attached to one another. The papyrus illustrated
here, P.Col. inv. 543b from the Rare Book and Manuscript Library 
of Columbia University, was catalogued as the fragment of a letter 
(which it was intended to appear to be), but is in fact four fragments
from a copy of Homer’s Iliad: for its publication see [Julia Lougovaya,
