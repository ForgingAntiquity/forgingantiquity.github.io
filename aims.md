# Project aims

As well as journal articles on fake papyri, forgers, and related issues, the project aims at three main outcomes:

1. A volume treating forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt, with editions and commentary.

2. A monograph on the mid-nineteenth century master forger and self-taught manuscript expert Constantine Simonides. 
This will focus primarily on the collection of forged papyri in the World Museum at Liverpool and on Simonides’ time in 
England in 1859–1863, telling the story of someone forging Greek history, and selling it (literally and metaphorically)
to the English.

3. An online database of forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt.
