## Levi Bak
Levi is concluding his Bachelor of Ancient History specialising in ancient languages at Macquarie
University. In 2021 he completed a PACE internship investigating the origins and acquisition history of
the Macquarie University History Museum Papyrus Collection, and he is currently working as a research
assistant on the ARC Discovery Project, ‘Forging Antiquity: Authenticity, Forgery and Fake Papyri.’ His
undergraduate capstone research project focuses on the use of divine names in the Greek Magical Papyri,
and what quality of power they might have been perceived to hold by the ritual practitioners. Coming
from a strong classics background, having previously completed a Cert. IV in Liberal Arts, Levi’s primary
interest lies in the field of historical linguistics and ancient languages.
