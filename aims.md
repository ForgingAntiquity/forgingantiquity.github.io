# Project aims

The project aims to produce a full typology of forged papyri of all types, from the early modern period to the 
present day, by a close exmaination of fake papyri of every type. Alongside this, we investigate how papyrus 
forgers work, both in terms of the methods they use, and the assumptions about the past which they exploit when
producing fakes. In doing do, we will locate and contextualise debates over forged papyri within contemporary
discussions, in particular debates over the ethics and practice of the antiquities trade and the related problem 
of the illegal trafficking of artefacts; and public perceptions of the relative value of scientific and
humanities expertise in the detection of forged artefacts.

* Journal articles and book chapters relating to the theme. Those in progress so far include:
  * a treatment by Yuen-Collingridge of 16th century forger Pierre Hamon;
  * an article by Choat on the development of authenticating techniques by Jean Mabillon;
  * a chapter by Choat on Forged papyri in a Handbook on Art Crime edited by Saskia Maria Hufnagel & Duncan Chappell (Palgrave Macmillan).

* A volume, co-edited by the project team along with collaborators, on forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt, with editions and commentary.

* A monograph, co-authored by Choat and Yuen-Collingridge, on the mid-nineteenth century master forger and self-taught manuscript expert Constantine Simonides. 
This will focus primarily on the collection of forged papyri in the World Museum at Liverpool and on Simonides’ time in 
England in 1859–1863, telling the story of someone forging Greek history, and selling it (literally and metaphorically)
to the English.

* An online database of forged papyri from (or allegedly from) Egypt.

* A study by Dundler of the Internet trade in papyrus.

* An online Artefact Portal where members of the public can learn about the antiquities trade, provide us with stories about their own collections of antiquities, and connect with researchers about the past and present of the antiquities market.
