The conference “Manuscripts from the Margins” gathered together a group of the world’s leading experts in fake texts from throughout history to examine the forging of manuscripts (defined widely to include all surfaces on which writing is found) of all sorts. The conference had two parts. A two-day workshop on the 20th–21st September, “How to Edit a Forgery”, and a day of public lectures on synthetic themes, “Faking it”.
